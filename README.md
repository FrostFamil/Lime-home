# Lime-home

### Hi Here I tried to finish the demo task that given to me from Limehome. It is written in React-Native using Expo.

## Here I want to mention few stuff first the project is in Master branch you can check it from there.

## Also about the project I tried to organize screens, styles and components as much as I can but still know there are some stuff that I can create reusable component from them just to use in future.

## I did not stored texts in seperate file since there wasn't much text was in the app that was hard coded but should definetally needs to be done it really helps in future for avoiding string typo errors or changing text easily in many places by changing one file.

## Didn't add Redux since I didn't think it will be neccessary for because I dont think states from some screens need to be globally accessible.

## In Details screen didn't add cancel button top instead you can just swipe your finger from left to right and it will return back to previous map screen, reasone behind that was I think gestures are more handy when it comes to go back since button was also at the top so from user point of view I thought gestures was better.
